Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two is a platforming video game that was released for the Nintendo Wii in 2012. It is the sequel to the 2010 game Epic Mickey, and it features Mickey Mouse and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit as the main playable characters. The game is set in a world called Wasteland, where forgotten and rejected creations of Disney live. The game's story revolves around the return of the Mad Doctor, who claims to have reformed and wants to help Wasteland from a new threat. However, not everything is as it seems, and Mickey and Oswald have to work together to save the day.
 
The game is notable for being one of the few Wii games that supports high-definition graphics and Dolby Pro Logic II sound when played on a Wii U console. The game also features a musical score composed by Jim Dooley, who won an Emmy Award for his work on the first game. The game also includes songs sung by the characters, such as "Yen Sid's Lab", "Prescott and the Pumps", and "The Mad Doctor's Plan". The game has a co-operative mode, where one player controls Mickey and the other controls Oswald. Mickey can use his magic paintbrush to create or erase objects, while Oswald can use his remote control to manipulate electricity and machines.

The game received mixed reviews from critics and fans, who praised its graphics, music, and voice acting, but criticized its camera, controls, and gameplay. Some also felt that the game was too easy and lacked challenge. The game sold poorly compared to its predecessor, and it was the last game developed by Junction Point Studios before they were shut down by Disney in 2013.
